            collaborators for that group, assign tasks for of collaborators in
            the federation.
            After assigning the tasks to collaborator, those tasks should be
            carried out each round (no reassignment between rounds).
        - GroupedAssigner :
            Given task groups and a list of collaborators that
            belong to that task group, carry out tasks for each round of
            experiment.
